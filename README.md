# rsa-algorithm
RSA Algorithm in C++

The program in this file consists of the traditional way to calculate the ciphertext and plaintext from the given data.

The two prime numbers are the most important components of the program, hence choose wisely, because changes in each of these may change the complete value.

The next function would be the calculation of Greatest Common Divisor or GCD.

The function of Inverse Modulo is also hand-made after the reading of wikipedia page about Modular Multiplicative Inverse

This is the simplest program you can get.
